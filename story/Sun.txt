Sundays Soundproofing tip!


Noise pollution is not easily defined. Part of the difficulty lies in the fact that in some ways it is different from other forms of pollution.

Noise is transient; once the pollution stops, the environment is free of it. This is not the case for chemicals, sewage, and other pollutants introduced into the air, soil, or water.

The definition of noise itself is highly subjective. To some people the roar of an engine is satisfying or thrilling; to others it is an annoyance. Loud music may be enjoyable or a torment, depending on the listener and the circumstances. Broadly speaking, any form of unwelcome sound is noise pollution, whether it is the roar of a jet plane overhead or the sound of a barking dog a block away.
