Saturdays Soundproofing Tip!

How does Sound Travel?

Sound travels in different ways depending on the medium. The medium is the material the sound is using to travel. Air is the most common. When sound travels through the air it normally originates from somewhere in space, like a speaker or a person's mouth, and then the waves travel in spherical ripples, this is similar to water waves: those travel in circular ripples because the surface of water is flat.
