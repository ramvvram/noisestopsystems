Wednesdays Soundproofing Question.

What is a decibel (dB)?

The decibel is a logarithmic unit for ratios that is used in a number of scientific disciplines. 
Other examples are the Richter scale for earthquake event energy and pH for hydrogen ion concentration in liquids. 

In all cases the logarithmic measure is used to compare the quantity of interest with a 
reference value, often the smallest likely value of the quantity. Sometimes that reference 
can be an approximate or average value. 

Most often in common acoustics, the decibel is used to compare the sound pressure level (SPL) 
in air with a reference pressure. 
The reference level for sound intensity (I), sound power level (PWL) and sound pressure 
in water are amongst others that are in common use: 

Reference sound pressure (in air) = 0.00002 = 2E-5 Pa (rms) " " 
Intensity = 0.000000000001 = 1E-12 W/m^2 " " 
Power = 0.000000000001 = 1E-12 W " " 
Pressure (water) = 0.000001 = 1E-6 Pa Acousticians use the dB scale for the following reasons: 
1) Quantities of interest often exhibit such huge ranges of variation that a dB scale is 
More convenient than a linear scale. For example, sound pressure radiated by a 
Submarine may vary by eight orders of magnitude depending on direction; expression in 
Linear units carry with it the confusion of the location of the decimal point. 
Decibels values are characteristically between only -999 to +999. 
2) The human ear interprets loudness more easily represented with a 
Logarithmic scale than with a linear scale.
