Thursdays Soundproofing Tip.

Soundproofing is very expensive!!

Soundproofing does not have to be expensive for it to give a good reduction in sound.
Yes the more you spend the better the results are likely to be, but this doesn’t mean you can not get a good reduction with other materials.

Soundproofing is dependant on: Density, Separation and Depth.
If you are on a small budget please do not use carpet, or thermal insulation it doesn’t work neither does mattress foam from old beds.

You need to use the correct material, if you are looking for a budget method contact us and we will advice the best options to you.
