Tuesday Soundproofing Question.

What is sound?

Sound is the quickly varying pressure wave within a medium that can travel widely in that medium. 
We usually mean audible sound, which is the sensation (as detected by the ear) of very small rapid changes in the air pressure above and below a static value. This "static" value is atmospheric pressure (about 100,000 Pascals) which does nevertheless vary slowly, as shown on a barometer. 

Associated with the sound pressure wave is a flow of energy. Sound is often represented diagrammatically as a sine wave, but physically sound (in air) is a longitudinal wave where the wave motion is in the direction of the movement of energy. 

The wave crests can be considered as the pressure maxima whilst the troughs represent the pressure minima.
